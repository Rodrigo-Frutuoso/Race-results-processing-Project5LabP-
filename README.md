The objective of this project is to develop a code to process and analyze the results of sports races, specifically single-stage races with control posts. 

The software should be able to manipulate vectors and matrices, perform searches and sorts in vectors, process time series, create rankings, and perform data analysis with a graphical component. 

The project will be implemented using specific classes and methods to acquire and process data from CSV files.
